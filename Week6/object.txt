Let us say a Nation has the following attributes:
	Has a Nation capital
	Has a population size

Each Nation can do the following things:
	Tell us what its capital is
	Tell us what its population is
	Increase its population by 1

As each nation is independent, only each nation can change its own attributes.



Write a function that takes in an array of Nations, an integer representing 
the relevant size of the array, and an additional Nation named Cmp.

When called, the function should take all the Nations with a population less 
than Cmp and move them towards the left side of the array, so that within 
size, all Nations with a population less than Cmp will be to the left of all 
the Nations with population not less than Cmp.

The function should also return the number of Nations with a population less 
than that of Cmp.

The order between the Nations with populations less than Cmp does not matter, 
nor does the order between Nations with populations not less than Cmp.




Function header:
int pivot(Nation array[], int size, Nation pole);




Example:
Nation 	France(67, "Paris"), 			Italy(60, "Rome"),
		USA(325, "Washington D.C."), 	Japan(128, "Tokyo"),
		Thailand(69, "Bangkok"), 		Brazil(209, "Brasilia");
Nation States[5] = { France, Italy, USA, Thailand, Brazil };
pivot(States, 5, Japan)

	â†’ returns 3
// States becomes { France, Italy, Thailand, USA, Brazil };
