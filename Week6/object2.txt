Let us say a Nation has the following attributes;
	Has a population size
	Has a current year, which starts at zero for all nations
	Has a list of number of births for each year
	Has a list of number of deaths for each year

Each Nation can do the following things:
	Tell us what its current population is
	Tell us what the current year is
	Pass time by a year, during which
		the population increases by its birth rate for that year
		and decreases by its death rate for that year.
		The birth rate triples
		The death rate doubles

As each nation is independent, only each nation can change its own attributes.



We will concern ourselves with the following nations:
	France
		initial population - 2000
		initial Birth Rate - 100
		initial Death Rate - 75
	USA
		initial population - 5000
		initial Birth Rate - 500
		initial Death Rate - 475
	Japan
		initial population - 3000
		initial Birth Rate - 100
		initial Death Rate - 200
	Brazil
		initial population - 4000
		initial Birth Rate - 375
		initial Death Rate - 100
