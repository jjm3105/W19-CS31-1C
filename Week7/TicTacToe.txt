Write a class TicTacToe that simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 board.

A board is represented as:

		O..
		.OX
		...

	the top left being position (1, 1) 
	the bottom right being position (3, 3)
	Empty spots are represented with '.'
A game always starts with O's turn.

The class should implement the following public members:
	A constructor with no inputs
		starts a game with an empty board with it being O's turn to play.

	bool placePiece(int r, int c)
		Places a game piece of the current player (X or O) at position r,c.
		Returns true
			if successful
			the next turn will be the player other than the current player.
		Returns false
			if another piece has already been placed in the position
			if the game has already ended.

	bool isOTurn()
		Returns true if current turn belongs to O and false otherwise

	char getWinner()
		Returns 'X' if X has won the current game
				'O' if O has won the game,
				'=' if neither has won and no board postion is empty.
				'?' if the current game has not ended.

	void clear()
		Clears all game pieces from the board and starts a new game

	void display()
		Displays the current board as a ASCII figure


Write your own TicTacToe.h and TicTacToe.cpp files for the class.
A main.cpp file has been provided for your use.

I've also provided an executable called "game" that should run on lnxsrv.
Hopefully it will help you get an idea of how the class is supposed to work.

The provided executable is the result of running the command
	g++ main.cpp TicTacToe.cpp -o game
	with main.cpp, TicTacToe.cpp, and TicTacToe.h in your local folder.
You can run the executable with the command
	./game
