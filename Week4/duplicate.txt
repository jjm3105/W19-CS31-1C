You are given an array of integers called A, which has size n and whose 
elements have values ranging from 1 to n-1​.​ Assume n < 500.

Write a function ​findDuplicate ​that takes in the array A, and returns any 
element of A that is not unique (if multiple elements satisfy that property, 
return any one of them).

If every element in A is unique, return 0.


Function header:
int findDuplicate(const int A[], int n);


Sample Code:
int A[7] = {1, 3, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1};
findDuplicate(A, 7);
	→ returns 3 or 1
