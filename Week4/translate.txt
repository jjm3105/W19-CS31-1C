Write a function that takes in a string and translates the string according to
the following rule:

Every letter in the string earlier in the alphabet than 'm' becomes a '0',
and every character after and including 'm' in the alphabet becomes a '1',
Any character in the string that is not a letter is unchaged.

If there is an even number of 1's, return true. Otherwise, return 0.


Function header:
bool translate(string& str);


Sample Code:
string s = "CS is the best"; 
cout << translate(s) << endl;
	→ returns true
cout << s << endl;
	→ returns "01 01 100 0011"
