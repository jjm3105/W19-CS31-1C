Let's say we represent a train as a string.
	
Each car in the train is composed of 4 characters
	The first character represents the color
		The character can be any letter
	The next two characters represent the number of passengers in the car
	The last character represent what the car contains
		P: Passengers
		C: Cargo
A train is a sequence of 1 or more cars, separated by 1 or more dashes.
	No dash precedes the first car, or follows the last car.


For example:
G37C--B15P
This represents a green car full of 37 containers of cargo, followed by a blue car with 15 passengers.


Write the following functions:

bool syntax(string train)
	Returns whether the given input is a proper train

void tally(string train, string color, int& seats)
	Given a valid train, changes the parameter seats to the total number of 
	passengers in the train in a car of the given color.


Sample Code:
string train = "G37C-B15P----Y39P-B18C---B23P";
string color = "B";
int seats;

if(syntax(train))
    tally(train, color, seats);

cout << seats << endl;
	â†’ returns 38
