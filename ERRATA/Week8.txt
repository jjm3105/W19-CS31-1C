Hi guys,


I realized that I said some wrong things in discussion this week.
During the last 10 minutes of class, I wrote:


int arr[2][2] = { {1, 2}, {10, 20} };
int* ptr = arr;


The above code DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK. It should actually be:


int arr[2][2] = { {1, 2}, {10, 20} };
int* ptr = &arr[0][0]


There is no valid conversion between ptr and arr, a two dimensional array. 
Instead, we should have ptr point to the first element in arr. From there, we 
can use what we talked about in class.

I apologize for the confusion. If you have any questions, about this or any
other topic, please email me at jmyong@g.ucla.edu


Your LA,
Jonathan Myong
