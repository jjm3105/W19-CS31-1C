Say we have the following class Room:

	class Room {
	public:
		Room(string s) {
			name = s;
		}
		void DecidePrice(int input) {
			price = input;
		}
		int GetPrice() {
			return price;
		}
		string GetName() {
			return name;
		}
	private:
		int price;
		string name;
	};

We want to create a class House that has the following declaration:

	class House {
	public:
		House();
		void SetPrice(int room, int price);
		void ListPrice();
	private:
		// ?????
	};

Each house has three rooms. The first room will be named "Living Room", the second "Bedroom", and the third "Bathroom".
The function SetPrice will set price of each room to a given price.
The function ListPrice() will print to screen the price of each room.
	e.g.
		The Living Room has price 1000
		The Bedroom has price 2000
		The Bathroom has price 3000

Finish the declaration and implement the class House.
You are not allowed to change the class Room.
