// Strings

Howie the 6 year old is playing with a calculator. As his first grade teacher
failed to teach him the importance of parentheses, Howie simply pushes the
parentheses buttons whenever he likes.

As Howie's older sibling, it is your job to "correct" what Howie types into
his calculator. Given a string representing an invalid input, such as
	"(3+(6)-(2*7)"
Output the number of additional closing parentheses needed to make the input a
valid input.


Sample Output:
Input: (3+((6)-(2*7)
Output: ))
