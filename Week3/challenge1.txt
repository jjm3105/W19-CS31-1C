// Challenge problem

Let's say we can describe numbers using it's "look and say" description, where
we "look" at each digit of a number and "say" how many there are.

For example, the number 11539 would be described as:
	"21151319"
as there are "two 1's", "one 5", "one 3", and "one 9", in that order.

Write a function that takes as input the "look and say" description of a
number as a string, and output the number the description is about as a string.

You can assume that the actual number will have no more than 9 of the same
digits in a row.


Sample Output:
lookAndSay(311322) would output 111322


Challenge:
Write a function that does the same thing, but whose input and output are both
of the type integer, not string.
