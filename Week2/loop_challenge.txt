// Challenge Problem with loops

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence of numbers, where each term in the
sequence is the sum of the two previous terms. For our purposes, the 1st and
the 2nd terms are 1 and 1:
	1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...

Given an integer N, output the Nth Fibonacci number.
Do NOT use recursion (if you don't know what this is, don't worry about this
requirement - this is not covered in this class, but makes the problem easier).


Sample Output:
Give a number: 8
The 8th Fibonacci number is 21.
